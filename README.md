# This is our GitHub Page. It's pretty cool huh?

We just started today - so there's nothing here yet. But we will be adding challenges, examples, and competitions here over the coming weeks. So make sure you stay tuned.

Until then - have you checked out our [social space](https://app.ctyi.ie)? This place is clearly the best way to get stuck into everything CTYI and share new thoughts and suggestions, provide testimonials, update some chants and traditions, and chat with long lost friends. Seriously - chek it out and make sure to tell a friend :)
